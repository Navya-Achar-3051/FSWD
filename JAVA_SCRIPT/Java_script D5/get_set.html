<!--
Getters and Setters
Classes also allow you to use getters and setters.

It can be smart to use getters and setters for your properties, especially if you want to do something special with the value before returning them, or before you set them.

To add getters and setters in the class, use the get and set keywords.

Note: even if the getter is a method, you do not use parentheses when you want to get the property value.

The name of the getter/setter method cannot be the same as the name of the property, in this case carname.

<h1>JavaScript Class Getter/Setter</h1>
<p>A demonstration of how to add getters and setters in a class, and how to use the getter to get the property value.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>
<!--
<script>
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  get cnam() {
    return this.carname;
  }
  set cnam(x) {
    this.carname = x;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myCar.cnam;
</script>

<h1>JavaScript Class Getter/Setter</h1>
<p>Using an underscore character is common practice when using getters/setters in JavaScript, but not mandatory, you can name them anything you like, but not the same as the property name.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this._carname = brand;
  }
  get carname() {
    return this._carname;
  }
  set carname(x) {
    this._carname = x;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myCar.carname;
</script>
-->

<!---->
<h1>JavaScript Class Setters</h1>
<p>When using a setter to set a property value, you do not use parantheses.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this._carname = brand;
  }
  set carname(x) {
    this._carname = x;
  }
  get carname() {
    return this._carname;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Ford");
myCar.carname = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myCar.carname;
</script>
